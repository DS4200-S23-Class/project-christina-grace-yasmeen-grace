    <h1>Comparison of US Food Prices and Food Stamp Usage</h1>

    <div>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        Our target user will be policymakers looking to understand the impacts of food prices and access to
        food on different demographics in the US by state. This visualization would help them see which
        states tend to have greater rates of food insecurity and the corresponding prices of produce that
        come with it, providing them with information on what specific areas may need more assistance or
        restructuring of the food industry in order to increase access to healthy food. Our domain situation
        is policy makers needing to make well-informed decisions regarding food insecurity and food
        accessibility. The domain problem is that low-income households lack financial resources for food and
        have limited access to several categorical food options. Policymakers face challenges with designing
        and implementing effective policies for addressing food insecurity and improving access to food for
        low-income households. Food stamps are a tool used to address this issue, but there are many complex
        and interrelated issues that they have to consider when analyzing the effectiveness. They need to look
        at the trade-offs between immediate relief and promoting long-term self-sufficiency. They need to look
        at the impact of the economy and the effects of food distributors and retailers. It is important to
        consider the changes in consumer behavior through food stamp usage and food prices to analyze the
        overall landscape of food assistance programs.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        TODO: Add link to report, demo video, link to data etc. here  
        <h3>Data</h3>
            Within our project, we plan on using and visualizing two different datasets. These two datasets
            contain information about food stamp usage by state over time, as well as grocery prices by
            state and food category over time. The data from both of these datasets are collected by the
            U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The data about grocery prices is collected by Information
            Resources Inc. and updated and managed by the USDA Economic Research Service (ERS), while the data
            on food stamp usage is provided and managed under the USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). Since
            both of our datasets are provided directly from agencies of the federal government, there should not
            be too much bias or ethical issues. The weekly grocery prices are collected by Information Resources,
            Inc. (IRI) using a nationally representative sample of retail food establishments and USDA ERS updates
            this data for the public monthly. There is a possibility for bias in this dataset because IRI does
            not collect data on food prices in 8 states/areas: Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, New Jersey, North
            Dakota, Montana, and Washington D.C., so we have some missing information. Similarly, there is some
            missing data on food stamp usage for the states Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Mississippi, and Washington
            D.C. which will result in some empty line charts for those states.
