    <h1>Comparison of US Food Prices and Food Stamp Usage</h1>

    <div>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        Our target user will be policy makers looking to understand the imacts of food prices and access to food on different demographics in the US by state. This visualization would help them see which states
        tend to have greater rates of food insecurity and the corresponding prices of produce that come with it, providing them with information on what specific areas may need more assistance or restructuring of the food industry in order to increase access to healthy food.

        TODO: Add link to report, demo video, link to data etc. here  
        <h3>Data</h3>
            Within our project, we plan on using and visualizing two different datasets. These two datasets contain information about food stamp usage by state over time, as well as grocery prices by state and food category over time. The data from both of these datasets are collected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The data about grocery prices is collected by Information Resources Inc. and updated and managed by the USDA Economic Research Service (ERS), while the data on food stamp usage is provided and managed under the USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). Since both of our datasets are provided directly from agencies of the federal government, there should not be too much bias or ethical issues. The weekly grocery prices are collected by Information Resources, Inc. (IRI) using a nationally representative sample of retail food establishments and USDA ERS updates this data for the public monthly. There is a possibility for bias in this dataset because IRI does not collect data in 12 states/areas: Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota, Mississippi, Montana, and Washington, D.C., so we have some missing information.
