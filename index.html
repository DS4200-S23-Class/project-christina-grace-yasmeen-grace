        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            Despite the United States being one of the highest developed countries in the world, according to the USDA, more than 34 million people experience food insecurity.  Food insecurity is defined as, "a household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food". Food accessibility still remains difficult to navigate despite the general presence of food stamps and assistance programs. Our visualization utilizes geo spatial mapping of food insecurity and provides a more representative picture of food insecurity as compared to the analysis of a single area. Our domain situation is that policymakers need to make well-informed decisions regarding food insecurity and accessibility. The domain problem is that low-income households lack financial resources for food and have limited access to certain food options. 
        </p>
           <p> Policy makers face challenges with designing and implementing effective policies for addressing food insecurity and improving access to food for low-income households. Food stamps are a tool used to address this issue, but there are many complex and interrelated issues that they have to consider when analyzing the effectiveness. For example, a policy maker, as a target user, might want to know the unit price of grains from 2020 to 2021 in Massachusetts and the food stamp usage. They first move the year slider to 2020 and select â€œgrains'' from the dropdown. After, they can click Massachusetts on the map and view the two line charts that pop up. They can then do the same thing for the year 2021. From 2020 they can see that the unit price of grains was between $2.45 and $2.75 and the population of people using food stamps was around 13%. On the other hand, in 2021 the unit price was between $2.68 and $2.90 and the percentage of the population using food stamps was well over 14%. Generally, as the unit price for grains increased, the amount of food stamp usage also increased. From this information they need to look at the trade-offs between immediate relief and promoting long-term self-sufficiency. In this situation immediate relief would be needed during 2020 as COVID caused an increase in prices. They need to look at the impact of the economy and the effects of food distributors and retailers. It is important to consider the changes in consumer behavior through food stamp usage and food prices to analyze the overall landscape of food assistance programs. By using a map of food stamps and unit price, policy makers can also track the effectiveness of their efforts to combat food insecurity over time. They can monitor changes in the availability and cost of healthy food options in targeted areas, as well as changes in food stamp usage, to determine whether their interventions are having the desired impact. By analyzing the map of food stamps and unit price, policy makers could identify regions where the cost of food is higher than average and if food stamp distribution should be increased. They can also determine if food insecurity and food prices improve over time.

        <h3>Data</h3>
            <p>
                Within our project, we plan on using and visualizing two different datasets. These two datasets
                contain information about food stamp usage by state over time, as well as grocery prices by
                state and food category over time. The data from both of these datasets are collected by the
                U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The data about grocery prices is collected by Information
                Resources Inc. and updated and managed by the USDA Economic Research Service (ERS), while the data
                on food stamp usage is provided and managed under the USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). Since
                both of our datasets are provided directly from agencies of the federal government, there should not
                be too much bias or ethical issues. The weekly grocery prices are collected by Information Resources,
                Inc. (IRI) using a nationally representative sample of retail food establishments and USDA ERS updates
                this data for the public monthly. There is a possibility for bias in this dataset because IRI does
                not collect data on food prices in 8 states/areas: Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, New Jersey, North
                Dakota, Montana, and Washington D.C., so we have some missing information. Similarly, there is some
                missing data on food stamp usage for the states Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Mississippi, and Washington
                D.C. which will result in some empty line charts for those states.
